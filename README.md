# Hi there  ðŸ‘‹
I'm Yago Moura, I graduated as an Industrial Automation Engineer and during the course discovered and became passionate about programming.

Despite having a great experience in the tech world as a Product Manager Intern, I still believed the industrial scene was my thing. Well, 3 years as an Automation Engineer have proven me wrong.

Going back and studying different technologies such as Python and Ruby on Rails, I'm now in search for an oportunity to enter the software development world.
